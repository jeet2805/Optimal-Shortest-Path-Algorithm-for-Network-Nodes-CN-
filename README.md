Optimal Routing Path Selection in Computer Networks using Intelligent Algorithms

This project implements an intelligent routing system for computer networks that identifies the optimal path for data transmission between source and destination nodes. The system models a computer network as a weighted graph, where nodes represent routers and edges represent communication links characterized by multiple parameters such as distance, cost, and delay. Using this network model, the project applies Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm for traditional routing and an intelligent routing algorithm that dynamically combines multiple metrics to compute the most efficient route.

To simulate real-world networking behavior, the system includes dynamic congestion modeling, where random traffic congestion is introduced by increasing link delays. The routing engine then recalculates the best available path, demonstrating adaptive routing behavior similar to modern networking protocols. This enables performance analysis under both normal and congested network conditions.

The project provides a terminal-based interactive interface that allows users to visualize network topology, compute shortest paths using different routing strategies, simulate congestion, and compare routing performance. Key performance metrics such as total routing weight, hop count, and path selection are displayed, enabling a clear comparison between classical and intelligent routing approaches.

By combining graph theory, routing algorithms, and traffic simulation, this project offers a practical understanding of core computer networking concepts, including routing optimization, congestion handling, and dynamic path selection. The modular design ensures clean architecture, scalability, and easy extensibility for future enhancements. Possible future improvements include machine learning–based traffic prediction, real-time packet simulation, and graphical visualization of routing paths. This project serves as a comprehensive academic demonstration of modern routing strategies and intelligent network optimization techniques.
